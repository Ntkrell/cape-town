## Our Itinerary
### Day 1
* Our flight arrived at 13:45 and it just took 45 minutes from the moment we got off the plane to our Airbnb on Bree street - incredible!
* Our [first Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/plus/16825409), located on the safe & centrally Bree street in the CBD. The city center is quite compact so you can get around easily on foot. Highly recommend this spot.
* After dropping our things we went out exploring and found a super delicious coffee joint: [Grind 4 Truth coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/Vt4CbZ2gUQM2). 
* Then we walked to [Marco's African Place](https://goo.gl/maps/grcVYaHgzxT2) and tried some wild food. The restaurant looked closed on the outisde -- but it wasn't! Although a bit touristy, the food came recommended and it was delicious. We ate the Serengeti platter which had crocodile tail, kudu and impala. It came with umngqusho: samp with beans, onions and potatoes. 
* We walked around Bree street and went for happy hour at [La Parada](https://goo.gl/maps/wKZBeXoGpo42) where they have 2 for 1 drinks from 5-7 pm. The tapas there looked good.
* For dinner we ate at [South China Dim Sum](https://goo.gl/maps/NbtqHADiP422). As J calls it, this was white people dim sum, but I really enjoyed it since we can't get anything like that in Kenya. 

### Day 2
* Coffee at Grind 4 truth again.
* [Iziko Bo Kaap Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/s2Gxhw95GRE2) - this house built in 1763 is the oldest in the Bo Kaap neighborhood: Malay's enclave nestled in Signal Hill. The museum showcases Cape Muslims' history and culture with its iconinic multi-colored brightly painted houses (done in the 90s when apartheid ended) with front terraces which typify Cape Muslim's social culture. The Dutch East India Company brought the original Malays to CT from 1658 who came from the Indonesian Islands, Sri Lanka and India. Bo-Kaap means "above Cape Town".
* [Biesmiellah Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/UphFv6Qez862) for lunch -- this restaurant does not appear to be much on the outisde & despite having burgers on the menu, it does serve yummy Cape Muslim food. We ate their samosas, [bobotie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobotie), and [denning vleis](https://www.cookhalaal.com/recipe/denning-vleis/). The food here is halal and it does not serve alcohol. 
* Walked around Green market square, which is dotted with historical buildings and open air market stands. 
* [District Six Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/7SRZTAgmTuJ2) - museum commemorating mixed-raced suburb which the apartheid razed in 1965 and relocated more than 60,000 people. 
* Coffee again at [Truth coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/Hq7GTh4CZjt). The epitome of hipster, this coffee shop serves coffee, teas, meals and desserts. J's long white came with a bear :) 
* Headed in uber (350 R each way) for a drive along the coast for dramatic views of False Bay and passed the cute towns of Fish Hoek and saw surfers in Muizenberg (where the water is 5ËšC warmer than the water on the western side of the peninsula). We visited the African penguin colony at [Boulder's Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/PeDvVvtLsC22) in Simon's Town. Simon's Town is a picturesque, quaint town which hosts South Africa's navy.
* We walked around Simon town's main drag and grabbed a beer at Nelson's Court inn. They had a Uruguayan flag waiving outside because Uruguyan navy ships were parked at SA's base.
* Dinner at [Obi](https://goo.gl/maps/B2uTpPou9Jv). Reservation is best. Affordable and delicious Japanese food, which is non-existent in Kenya. 

### Day 3
* Headed out early to take pictures of Bo Kaap. Stopped nearby the Airbnb for coffee. There are SO (!) many coffee shops in Cape Town. I grabbed a latte at Bean There: fair trade, Africa-sourced coffee beans in a compostable to-go cup :) 
* Bunch at [Bacon on Bree](https://goo.gl/maps/vQPSyVKwETM2). Excellent food. You'll leave smelling like bacon. 
* We headed in an uber to our second Airbnb in Sea Point, a coastal neighborhood below Signal Hill
* Headed to the [next Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15712394) in Sea Point. Right next to the water but less nice of an Airbnb than the first. 
* Took an Uber to the [V&A Waterfront](https://goo.gl/maps/JP2VqSoPrkT2) we wanted to visit Robben Island but our tour was cancelled because of the poor weather conditions. Instead we walked around the water front, the V&A food market and visited the Two Oceans Aquarium. We sipped on some beers at [Ferrymans Tavern](https://goo.gl/maps/adTccbmKpwM2) which was just okay and [GINJA](https://goo.gl/maps/Sup24EjiwMD2) which was very nice and afforded people watching by the water. 
* [Mzansi](https://goo.gl/maps/iQVVgQh7gyE2) is the #1 restaurant for Cape Town on TripAdvisor and where we ate dinner. Reservations are necessary. You'll get an authentic Xhosa meal with entertainment and heart-warming stories by the owner. 

### Day 4
* [Jarryds](https://goo.gl/maps/wBy1ZwiyBnp) for breakfast. The food here was okay. We went merely out of convenience since it was walking dist from our Airbnb.
* [Lion's Head](https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/lions-head.php) is a hike on Signal Hill. We left for the hike at 9am and it was just starting to get crowded. Our Uber dropped us off at the [parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/4okBTPB3fT12). The hike was fairly straightforward but did involve some scrambling and going up ladders. I wouldn't recommend this hike when it's raining. Beautiful views.  
* We headed to [The Neighbourgoods Market](https://goo.gl/maps/PA8e3iX1yBT2) for lunch, which is only open on Saturdays. We also visited two breweries within walking distance: [Woodstock Grill & Tap](https://goo.gl/maps/aKbGkpY56Y42) and [The Brewers Coop](https://goo.gl/maps/Nnaxy5Lwoc42). Heads up! Our credit card info was taken from Woodstock Grill, so don't recommend going there!
* In the evening, we took an hour's walk (`~`4.5 km) from Sea Point to Camps Bay, passing Bantry Bay and Clifton along the way. This coastal stroll was beautiful with beachy and rocky shores, and very nice homes on the water. It felt a bit like Malibu and the setting sun was perfect.
* [Codfather Seafood & Sushi](https://goo.gl/maps/UraR95fXJqv) for dinner. This was our last Guardian-recommended restaurant. I was a little nervous at first since it wasn't on Camps Bay main drag, but we were blown away by the food and drinks. There is no written menu: you select your fish from the counter's daily fresh catch and they prepare it and serve with a couple sides. We had an incredible meal for a price that blew us away. 

### Day 5
* [Kleinsky's Deli](https://goo.gl/maps/P3HEG7J4u7t) for breakfast. Jewish bites like challah french toast and latke benedicts. Our stomaches were a bit off after this meal but it was good anyways. 
* Before heading to the airport, we took a stroll along Beach Road passing Sea Point Pavilion and Milton Beach in Sea Point. 

## Beers
* We tasted a fair number of beers. You can check them out [here](https://untappd.com/user/Jovinslvr/lists/379675). Need to be logged in to see. 

## Things we didn't do
* Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden - our Uber driver was born here (probably 1950s) but now it is a garden at the foot of the Table Mountain range.
* Cape of Good Hope, Table Mountain National Park - hike with stunning views.
* Castle of Good Hope - oldest standing building in SA. Need at least 90 minutes to explore. 
* The Castle of Good Hope or the Slave Lodge.
* Cape Point. 
* The Constantia Winelands.
* Iziko Slave Lodge - second oldest colonial building in Cape Town. This lodge hosted the slaves that worked in the Company's Garden built in 1679. 
* Table Mountain - 3-4 hour round trip in cable car. Can hike to summit and have a bite at the scenic restaurant.
* Robben Island- Booked our tickets online because we saw there were many days without available slots. Ticket price was inclusive of ferry, guide and tour. 350 Rand each. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Robben Island (meaning "Seal Island" in Dutch) has served as a penla settlement as early as 1636. The South African Prison Service took over in 1960 and closed as a prison in 1991. Nelson Mandeal, its most famous inmate, for 18 years. Attractions on the island are the Governor's House (ca 1895), the Lighthouse, the Lime Quarry (where political prisoners were required to work for at least 6 hrs per day), the Church of Good Shepherd and the Prison. The Island also has a signicant seabird population with over 130 sp. The Caspian Tern is an endangered bird that breeds on the island. 4 hour tour.
